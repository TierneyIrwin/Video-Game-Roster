If you want to create entirely new rating, company and video game listings please follow this order.
# Create your Rating
Go to the Ratings tab and there will be your entries. Make sure your date is in the format YYY-MM-DD
and your rating is a float value of some sort. Click the Add Rating button once you are done.
# Create your Company
Go to the Companies tab and there will lie your entries for your company information. Here make sure
your Established date is in the format YYYY-MM-DD. Click the Add Company button once finished.
# Create your Video Game 
Go to the Videogames tab and enter in your information for your videogame in the fields provided. 
Make sure here your Release date is in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Choose your corresponding company and rating from the drop down menus provided. Press Add Game once finished.
# To Update/Delete listings
Traverse to which listing you wish to update and click on the Learn More link to the right. From there you see more information as well as can update/delete that listing. You cannot delete a rating/company that is used for a video game listing as it is still useful to the tables. If you wish to delete those being used, either delete or update the game that is using those listings first then you may delete those now unused listings.

# Thank You!
Remember there is a return button always at the bottom of the page to return to your previous location.
Hope you enjoy the minty colour. :)
